# Replicated-Spectral-Variance-Estimator

 This repository contains reproducible code for all simulations and examples in the Agarwal and Vats (2021) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01799). The examples include
 
 #### Gaussian mixture model
 #### Vector autoregressive model (VAR-1)
 #### Boomerang distribution
 #### Sensor network model
 #### Poisson change-point model
 #### Network crawling
 
 All the figures and tables in the paper are produced serially using the script "one_run.R" and saved in the folder "AllOut". This script uses 
pre-obtained R objects to save simulation time. Each example folder contains the code for producing these objects, figures, and tables. Read the readme.txt for detailed explanation.
